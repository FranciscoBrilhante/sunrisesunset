# Sunrise Sunset Assignment

This is an implementation of the Jumpseller assignment using two components

- frontend React client (Vite + React)
- backend API (Ruby on Rails)

## Running with Docker

```bash
  docker compose up -d
```
To run the assignment you will need to set the following environment variables.

In a real application, `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` should not be exposed like done here ðŸ˜‰.

```bash
  VITE_API_HOST=127.0.0.1
  VITE_API_PORT=4000
  RAILS_MASTER_KEY=0b30adb6f45042e69dbd3580b37f8531
```

> **_NOTE:_**  I had some issues with git adding CRLF line breaks to some scripts preventing the app from running. Make sure `/backend/bin/thrust`, `/backend/bin/ruby`, `/backend/bin/rake` and `/backend/bin/docker-entrypoint` end with LF.

## Running Locally
